# BPM playlists script

Here lies a script that was once very handy, until November 2024, when Spotify stopped providing audio features through its API.

The script obtained a JSON file with a playlist and the preferred ranges of parameters such as bpm, danceability, speechiness, key, etc.
The songs in the playlist (or saved songs) were then filtered based on these parameters and saved into a new playlist. 
That way, one could create a happy playlist for running at a specific BPM or filter only sad songs in a specific key.
